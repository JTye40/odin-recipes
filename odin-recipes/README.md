Odin Project Recipe Website

This basic website will include an index page with multiple links to my favorite recipes. 

The purpose of this project is to fortify and improve upon my HTML language skills and aptitude.

I intend to demonstrate knowledge and the use of best HTML coding practices, proper use of tags, syntax, and attributes, and implement a clean and functional webpage.
