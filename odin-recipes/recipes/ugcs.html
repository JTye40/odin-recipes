            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><h3>Ingredients:</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>8 slices good quality bread</li>
            <li>Mayonaisse</li>
            <li>12 oz Gruyere cheese</li>
            <li>6 oz White cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>4 slices thin Meunster cheese</li>
            <li>2 yellow onions</li>
            <li>1 tsp fresh thyme</li>
            <li>2 tsp fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>1 tsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>salt & pepper <em>to taste</em></li>
            <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h3>Steps to Make:</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 1-1/2 Tbsp butter and olive oil to a skillet and heat 
                over <strong>MED-LOW</strong> heat. Add diced onions, salt, 
                pepper, fresh thyme and 1 tsp of fresh rosemary to the hot 
                skillet and saute, stirring often, until onions are soft 
                and starting to brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir brown sugar into the onions and cook another minute.</li>
            <li>Transfer onions to a plate.</li>
            <li>Spread one side of two pieces of bread with a little bit 
                of mayonnaise.</li>
            <li>To the same skillet, add remaining butter and rosemary, 
                and heat over <strong>MED</strong> heat. Swirl to coat 
                the bottom of the skillet with the melted butter.</li>
            <li>Add both pieces of bread, mayonnaise side down, and cook 
                until bread is golden brown and crunchy, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>As soon as you add the bread to the skillet, add a bit of 
                cheese to the top of each piece of bread. Once it starts 
                to melt a little, sprinkle a couple tablespoons of the 
                caramelized onions over the top of one of the pieces of 
                bread.</li>
            <li>When the bread is good and golden brown, sandwich the pieces 
                of bread together and cook on <strong>LOW</strong> until 
                cheese is fully melted.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a plate, repeat with remaining slices of bread and 
                ingredients.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
