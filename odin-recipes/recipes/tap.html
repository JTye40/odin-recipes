        <p><h3>Description:</h3></p>
        <p>Tacos al pastor are a vibrant celebration of flavors, featuring 
            succulent marinated pork that’s been slow-cooked on a vertical 
            spit, reminiscent of shawarma. The meat is infused with a 
            delightful blend of spices, achiote, and citrus, creating a 
            tantalizingly smoky and slightly sweet profile. Each taco is 
            lovingly tucked into a warm, soft corn tortilla, topped with 
            freshly chopped onions, vibrant cilantro, and a splash of zesty 
            pineapple. A drizzle of tangy salsa adds the perfect finishing 
            touch, making every bite a harmonious explosion of savory, sweet, 
            and spicy notes. These tacos are not just a meal; they’re an 
            irresistible experience that transports you straight to the 
            heart of Mexico!

        <p><h3>Steps to Make:</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut Pork: Remove any large pieces of fat. Slice the pork 
                horizontally into long, 1/4" thick pieces (you could see 
                if your butcher would do this).
            </li>
            <li>Soften Chiles: Remove seeds and veins from the dried chiles 
                (wear gloves if desired). Add to a small saucepan cover with 
                water. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 15 minutes, to 
                soften the chiles.
            </li>
            <li>Blend: Add chiles and ¼ cup of water from the pot (discard 
                remaining water) to a high powdered blender. Add onion, 
                garlic cloves, allspice, peppercorn, cloves, Mexican oregano, 
                cumin, ginger, achiote powder, salt, apple cider vinegar, and 
                juice. Blend until completely smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Marinate: Add pork to a large bowl or ziplock bag and spread 
                mixture all over pork, tossing to coat. Cover and refrigerate 
                for several hours, or overnight.
            </li>
            <li>Grill Pork: Remove pork from marinade and cook on a very hot 
                grill for a few minutes on each side until just shy of 145 
                degrees F. Remove to a cutting board allow to rest.
            </li>
            <li>Grill pineapple: Brush pineapple spears with olive oil and 
                place on hot grill, cooking briefly on both sides. Remove 
                and chop into pieces.
            </li>
            <li>Assemble Tacos: Chop pork into small pieces for serving. 
                Warm tortillas in a hot dry skillet or on the grill. Top 
                tortillas with a spoonful of pork some pineapple, onion, 
                cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice.
            </li>
